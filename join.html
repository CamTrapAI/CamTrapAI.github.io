Note that by joining you agree to observe for all interactions during or related to the workshop our House Rules of Engagement <https://help.blogs.bristol.ac.uk/2018/12/19/university-of-bristol-comment-moderation-house-rules> applicable to both live streams of video, audio and texts, posts as well as Q&A posting. Please generally mute your microphone. There will be a Q&A available for text exchange and questions. If your Teams client does not support the Q&A button then you may raise your hand (virtually) during the discussion sessions for questions and the chair will try to reach out to you if there is time. The MS Teams Link to the events will appear here closer to the events.
